Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn 't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won 't give you Vitamin D - - but sunlight will...
If you 're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog 's ear

Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...

Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...

Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of ISO9660 standard which is supported by most of the operating systems including Linux and all versions of Windows Â©. However MacOS X cannot read images created with version 3 of ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it; but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. NOTE: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on linux.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windows Â©. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Ne _ ver Add Such File

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it; but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection?
The children of this directory will have 7 parent directories. Brasero can create an image of such a file hierarchy and burn it but the disc may not be readable on all operating systems. Note: Such a file hierarchy is known to work on Linux.
Ne _ ver Add Such File

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

Do you really want to add "% s" to the selection and use the third version of the ISO9660 standard to support it?
The size of the file is over 2 GiB. Files larger than 2 GiB are not supported by the ISO9660 standard in its first and second versions (the most widespread ones). It is recommended to use the third version of the ISO9660 standard, which is supported by most operating systems, including Linux and all versions of Windowsâ„¢. However, Mac OS X cannot read images created with version 3 of the ISO9660 standard.
Should files be renamed to be fully Windows - compatible?
Those names should be changed and truncated to 64 characters.

This is the Ekiga general configuration assistant. The following steps will set up Ekiga by asking a few simple questions. Once you have completed these steps, you can always change them later by selecting Preferences in the Edit menu.
Welcome to Ekiga
Personal Information
Please enter your first name and your surname:
Your first name and surname will be used when connecting to other VoIP and videoconferencing software.
If you do not have a SIP or H323 account, ekiga can only be used on your local internal network (inside your company, for example). You will require an account if you want to be accessible to people on the Internet. Many web sites allow you to create an account. We suggest that you use a free ekiga. net account, which allows you to be joined by any person with a SIP account. If you want to call regular phone lines too, we suggest that you purchase an inexpensive call out account. The following two pages allow you to create such accounts.
Introduction to Accounts
Ekiga. net Account
Please enter your username:
Please enter your password:
The username and password are used to login to your existing account at the ekiga. net free SIP service. If you do not have an ekiga. net SIP address yet, you may first create an account below. This will provide a SIP address that allows people to call you. You may skip this step if you use an alternative SIP service, or if you would prefer to specify the login details later.
I do not want to sign up for the ekiga. net free service
Ekiga Call Out Account
Please enter your account ID:
Please enter your PIN code:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this, you need to do two things: - First buy an account at the URL below. - Then enter your account ID and PIN code. The service will work only if your account is created using the URL in this dialog.
I do not want to sign up for the Ekiga Call Out service

This is the Ekiga general configuration assistant. The following steps will set up Ekiga by asking a few simple questions. Once you have completed these steps, you can always change them later by selecting Preferences in the Edit menu.
Welcome to Ekiga
Please enter your first name and your surname:
Your first name and surname will be used when connecting to other VoIP and videoconferencing software.
If you do not have a SIP or H323 account, ekiga can only be used on your local internal network (inside your company, for example). You will require an account if you want to be accessible to people on the Internet. Many web sites allow you to create an account. We suggest that you use a free ekiga. net account, which allows you to be joined by any person with a SIP account. If you want to call regular phone lines too, we suggest that you purchase an inexpensive call out account. The following two pages allow you to create such accounts.
Introduction to Accounts
Ekiga. net Account
Please enter your username:
Please enter your password:
The username and password are used to login to your existing account at the ekiga. net free SIP service. If you do not have an ekiga. net SIP address yet, you may first create an account below. This will provide a SIP address that allows people to call you. You may skip this step if you use an alternative SIP service, or if you would prefer to specify the login details later.
I do not want to sign up for the ekiga. net free service
Ekiga Call Out Account
Please enter your account ID:
Please enter your PIN code:
You can make calls to regular phones and cell numbers worldwide using Ekiga. To enable this, you need to do two things: - First buy an account at the URL below. - Then enter your account ID and PIN code. The service will work only if your account is created using the URL in this dialog.
I do not want to sign up for the Ekiga Call Out service
Connection Type
Please choose your connection type:
56k Modem
ISDN
DSL / Cable (128 kbit / s uplink)
DSL / Cable (512 kbit / s uplink)
LAN
Keep current settings
The connection type will permit determining the best quality settings that Ekiga will use during calls. You can later change the settings individually in the preferences window.
Please choose the audio ringing device:
The audio ringing device is the device that will be used to play the ringing sound on incoming calls.
Please choose the audio output device:
The audio output device is the device that will be used to play audio during calls.
Please choose the audio input device:
The audio input device is the device that will be used to record your voice during calls.
Video Input Device
Please choose your video input device:
The video input device is the device that will be used to capture video during calls.

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom - out or not. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom - in or not. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK _ PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is choosen, then the trans _ color key determines the used color value.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming or not.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0. 05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1. 00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether or not the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.
Show / hide the window toolbar.
Show / hide the window statusbar.
Show / hide the image collection pane.

Show / hide the window side pane.
Show / hide the image collection pane scroll buttons.
Trash images without asking
If activated Eye of GNOME wont ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the filechooser should show the user 's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the filechooser will display the user 's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e. g. as used by netbooks. If disabled the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.

Automatic orientation
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation.
Interpolate Image
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom - out. This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non interpolated images.
Extrapolate Image
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom - in. This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non - extrapolated images.
Transparency indicator
Determines how transparency should be indicated. Valid values are CHECK _ PATTERN, COLOR and NONE. If COLOR is choosen, then the trans _ color key determines the used color value.
Scroll wheel zoom
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming.
Zoom multiplier
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming. This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event. For example, 0. 05 results in a 5% zoom increment for each scroll event and 1. 00 result in a 100% zoom increment.
Transparency color
If the transparency key has the value COLOR, then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency.
Loop through the image sequence
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop.
Allow zoom greater than 100% initially
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially.
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically. Zero disables the automatic browsing.

Trash images without asking
If activated Eye of GNOME wont ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash. It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead.
Whether the file chooser should show the user 's pictures folder if no images are loaded.
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window, the file chooser will display the user 's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories. If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up it will show the current working directory.
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page.
If activated the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog. This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens, e. g. as used by netbooks. If disabled the widget will be embedded on the "Metadata" page.

Encode filenames in an Outlook / GMail way

Hi. Thanks for taking the time to download this preview release of the Evolution groupware suite. This version of Evolution is not yet complete. It is getting close, but some features are either unfinished or do not work properly. If you want a stable version of Evolution, we urge you to uninstall this version, and install version% s instead. If you find bugs, please report them to us at bugzilla. gnome. org. This product comes with no warranty and is not intended for individuals prone to violent fits of anger. We hope that you enjoy the results of our hard work, and we eagerly await your contributions!
Thanks The Evolution Team

This is the port on the LDAP server that Evolution will try to connect to. A list of standard ports has been provided. Ask your system administrator what port you should specify.
This is the method Evolution will use to authenticate you. Note that setting this to "Email Address" requires anonymous access to your LDAP server.
The search scope defines how deep you would like the search to extend down the directory tree. A search scope of "sub" will include all entries below your search base. A search scope of "one" will only include the entries one level beneath your base.

This is the port on the LDAP server that Evolution will try to connect to. A list of standard ports has been provided. Ask your system administrator what port you should specify.
This is the method Evolution will use to authenticate you. Note that setting this to "Email Address" requires anonymous access to your LDAP server.
The search scope defines how deep you would like the search to extend down the directory tree. A search scope of "sub" will include all entries below your search base. A search scope of "one" will only include the entries one level beneath your base.
